3. Line 9 will return 20.
4. This will cause an error because ```result`` has a block scope, not a function scope.
5. This will cause an error, because variables with ```const``` keyword cannot be reassigned a new value.
6. This is outside the scope, so this will return an error.


1. This will return 2, because ```i``` has a function scope.
2. This will return 150 due to having a function scope.
3. This will log 2.
4. This function will return an array of 3 finalPrice.
5. This causes an error because i is only valid in the for loop scope.

8. This will correctly return the array of finalPrice.
9. This will cause an error because ```i``` is out of scope.
10. This will return 3.
