1. ```student.name```
2. ```student['Grad Year']```
3. ```student.greeting()```
4. ```student['Favorite Teacher']['name']```
5. ```student.courseLoad[0]```


a. 32
b. 1
c. 3
d. 3null
e. 4
f. 0
g. 3undefined
h. NaN

It seems like integers in string format (ex. ```'3'```) are added as if they were a string, but the same does not apply in subtraction.

The boolean value ```true``` maps to 1. Adding a stringified integer and another datatype creates a new concatatened string.


a. true
b. Error
c. true
d. false
e. false
f. true


5. == performs type conversion when necessary, while === does not use type conversion (and therefore is more strict.)


17. We will have 2, 4, 6. ```newArr``` will have elements pushed that are doubled by the callback function ```doSomething```.

9. The output is 1 4 3 2 (newlines inbetween)
